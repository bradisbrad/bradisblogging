In an attempt to revamp the structure of this blog, largely to make it more maintainable, we're temporarily closed for business. The [update to blogdown v1.0](https://blog.rstudio.com/2021/01/18/blogdown-v1.0/) really threw off my previous structure of saying _"I honestly don't know where this goes and I'm too afraid to ask,"_ and then throwing it all into random folders and hoping the site doesn't break.

In the meantime, make one of these sites yourself! Here's an [excellent post by Alison Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/post/new-year-new-blogdown/) (no relation) on creating all of this in 6 easy steps. I had originally steered away from the Academic theme, but here we are, using Academic and _loving it!_ Or, at the very least, not listing it. And really, that's all Hilary Farr and David Visentin would ask of me.
